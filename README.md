# Bank-Customer-Churn-Analysis

The dashboard analyzes data from 10,000 customers, revealing a churn rate of 15.0% and a non-churn rate of 20.4%. Gender distribution is fairly balanced, and most customers are active. Product-wise, the majority use Product 1, while Products 2, 3, and 4 have smaller shares. Geographically, France holds the largest customer base, followed by Germany and Spain. Most customers own a credit card. In terms of behavioral trends, the highest number of customers fall within the credit score range of 601–700, but churn is most severe among those with scores below 400. Customers with account balances under \$10,000 are the most numerous, yet churn peaks among those with balances between \$100,000 and \$200,000. Age-wise, the 41–50 group dominates in size, while churn is highest among older customers, particularly those above 60. These insights help the bank identify high-risk segments and guide targeted retention strategies, product improvements, and personalized customer engagement efforts.

Recommendations

1. Strengthen Retention for High-Risk Segments - Customers with low credit scores, high account balances, and those in older age groups are showing the highest churn rates. The bank should implement targeted retention programs such as:
    a. Personalized financial counseling for low-credit customers.
    b. Premium loyalty benefits or concierge services for high-balance clients.
    c. Age-specific engagement strategies, like simplified digital tools or dedicated support for senior customers.

2. Re-engage Inactive Customers - Since inactive customers are more likely to churn, the bank should launch reactivation campaigns using:
    a. Personalized email or SMS offers.
    b. Incentives like fee waivers or bonus interest for re-engagement.
    c. Behavioral nudges through mobile apps or online banking.

3. Optimize Product Offerings - Product 1 has the largest user base, but the bank should assess its churn rate. If it's high, consider:
    a. Enhancing product features.
    b. Bundling with underperforming products (Prod 2–4) to increase value.
    c. Offering tiered versions to suit different customer needs.

4. Leverage Credit Card Ownership - If credit card ownership correlates with lower churn, promote card adoption through:
    a. Reward programs.
    b. Cashback offers.
    c. No annual fee options for new users.

5. Localize Customer Experience - France has the largest customer base, so retention efforts should be prioritized there. For Germany and Spain, conduct further analysis to understand regional churn drivers and tailor services accordingly.
